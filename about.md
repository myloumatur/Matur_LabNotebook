I am an  undergraduate student at Hawaii Pacific University focusing on Ciguatera Fish Poisoning. Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), a result of eating fish contaminated with the ciguatoxins (CTXs) produced by Gambierdiscus spp. dinoflagellates (primarily), is one of the most common food poisonings in the world. Here, I propose to go right to the source of the CTX toxins and detect the cell densities of the dinoflagellates producing them throughout Oahu, Hawaii.
